# UNC_BootCamp_Group_6

## Project Topic: Wine Quality
## Reason for selection: 
#### The dataset was comprehensive and was relevant to our project. It has attributes and labels necessary to build an effective machine learning model and we all love wine

## Description of the data source.
#### This dataset is two CSV's files (red and white wine) obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains the chemical composition and sensory quality ratings of red and white wines.

#### Each wine is rated on a scale of 1 to 10 based on sensory data such as taste, aroma, and color. The dataset contains 12 columns, including 11 input variables representing the chemical properties of wine and 1 output variable representing the quality rating
#### The input variables include:
* fixed acidity (g/dm³)
* volatile acidity (g/dm³)
* citric acid (g/dm³)
* residual sugar (g/dm³)
* chlorides (g/dm³)
* free sulfur dioxide (mg/dm³)
* total sulfur dioxide (mg/dm³)
* density (g/cm³)
* pH
* sulphates (g/dm³)
* alcohol (% vol.)
#### The output variable is:
* quality (score between 1 and 10)

## The Dataset questions?
* Can a machine learning model predict the quality of a given wine when given various properties and the wine type?
* Can a machine learning model predict the wine type of a given wine when given various properties and the quality?
* What are the average pH of red and white wines?
* What are the average citric acid for red and white wines?
* Is there a correlation between alcohol content and wine quality?
* Is there correlation between residual sugars and wine quality?

## Description of the data exploration phase of the project.
#### The data exploration phase of this project involved performing a preliminary analysis on the dataset to gain a better understanding of its structure, content, and relationships between variables. 
#### This was a  crucial phase because it helped our group identify patterns and trends in the data, which would help inform subsequent data analysis and modeling efforts.

## Description of the analysis phase of the project. 
#### The analysis phase of this dataset will involve using machine learning and statistical modeling techniques to explore the relationships between variables and develop models that can accurately predict the quality of wines based on their chemical properties. Below are questions we intend to answer in the analysis phase.
* Analyze average pH of red and white wines.
* Analyze average citric acid for red and white wines.
* Correlation between alcohol content and wine quality.
* Correlation between residual sugars and wine quality.
## Machine Learning Model
#### Train a machine learning model on the wine quality data set to identify the following:
* Predict wine type (red or white) given the properties of a wine and the quality (Logisitic Regression).
* Predict wine quality (1-10) given the properties of a wine and the wine type (Random Forest).

## Communication Protocols 
### Our communication protocols have evolved organically to streamline information flow for the final project.
#### 1.	Communication channels - our agreed upon primary communication channels consist of:
* Slack - used for quick check-ins and calendaring 
* Google Meets for video collaboration calls outside of class (Zoom in class)
* Email for sharing docs, files, etc.
2. Communication Etiquette has been naturally established to include all group members, fostering a collaborative environment, respecting the individual journey of each person in the learning process (finding humor in our varied abilities), and responding to group members in a timely manner. 
3. Regular meetings: 
* We have established as needed scheduled meetings between bootcamp classes to share project progress, address challenges, troubleshoot, ensure guidelines with rubrics are followed with a consensus, and share updates.
* Meetings are scheduled with the input of all members to respect time, work schedules, family, and sleep preferences. 
4. Document sharing and version control: 
* Google Meets and Slack are used for document sharing.
* GitHub is used to manage changes, revisions to code, and project related documents.
5. Clarity & Documentation:
* Documentation of tasks are outlined in slack, when needed, to address the scope of work for individual contribution.
6. Conflict Resolution: 
* Open communication is encouraged in working through natural disagreements.
7. Deadlines:
* We have agreed to meet rubric deadlines, as well as additional deadlines within our group as the project progresses.
* We hold each other accountable and provide support to ensure project tasks are completed and help is available as needed – mornings, evenings, weekends.
8. Documentation and Knowledge Sharing: 
* As we work through different stages of the project we take turns documenting progress.
* We have maintained GitHub as a central repository for easy access to shared information.
