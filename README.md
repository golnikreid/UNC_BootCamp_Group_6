** Topic and the reasoning for that selection. 
## Project Topic: Wine Quality
** Reason for selection: 
### The dataset was comprehensive and was relevant to our project. It has attributes and labels necessary to build an effective machine learning model and we all love wine![1_dFSpzDQJK50ur8ilFN59mQ](https://github.com/golnikreid/UNC_BootCamp_Group_6/assets/113741694/8e032d9e-64ce-4b40-abd4-278a490e7229)



** Description of the data source.
### This dataset is a CSV file obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  The dataset contains the chemical composition and sensory quality ratings of red and white wines.Each wine is rated on a scale of 1 to 10 based on sensory data such as taste, aroma, and color.  The dataset contains 12 columns, including 11 input variables representing the chemical properties of wine and 1 output variable representing the quality rating
### The input variables include:
#### fixed acidity (g/dm³)
#### volatile acidity (g/dm³)
#### citric acid (g/dm³)
#### residual sugar (g/dm³)
#### chlorides (g/dm³)
#### free sulfur dioxide (mg/dm³)
#### total sulfur dioxide (mg/dm³)
#### density (g/cm³)
#### pH
#### sulphates (g/dm³)
#### alcohol (% vol.)
## The output variable is:
#### quality (score between 1 and 10)

** The questions that the team planned to answer with the data.
### Can a machine learning model predict the quality of a given wine when given various properties and the wine type?
### Can a machine learning model predict the wine type of a given wine when given various properties and the quality?
### What are the average pH of red and white wines?
### What are the average citric acid for red and white wines?
### Is there a correlation between alcohol content and wine quality?
### Is there correlation between residual sugars and wine quality?
